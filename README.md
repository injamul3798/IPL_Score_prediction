Since the dawn of the IPL in 2008, it has attracted viewers all around the globe. A high level of uncertainty and last-minute nail-biters have urged fans to watch the matches. Within a short period, the IPL has become the highest revenue-generating league in cricket. In a cricket match, we often see the scoreline showing the probability of the team winning based on the current match situation. This prediction is usually done with the help of data analytics. Before, when there were no advancements in machine learning, predictions were usually based on intuition or some basic algorithms. The above picture clearly tells you how bad it is to take run rate as a single factor to predict the final score in a limited-overs cricket match.
